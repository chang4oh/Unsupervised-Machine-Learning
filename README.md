# Unsupervised Machine Learning
<br>Is machine learning without human intervention and without target variable y
<br>This means using algorithms such as k-means clustering, dimensionality reduction, and outlier detection
<br>Unsupervised may become semi-supervised with k nearest clustering with some target variable and rest non-target
<br>Used Kaggle's Vehicle Dataset for this Project
<br>Steps: planning->import data->EDA->data preprocessesing->Train Model->Metrics->Insights
<br>*each steps may be followed in varying order depending on MLA performance and have reached the objective
